# WonderfulWorld

See the site live at http://podrezo.github.io/wonderfulworld

WonderfulWorld is a small website that showcases some of the most beautiful and interesting places to travel to in the world. Unlike other travel-related sites of "top 10 this or that" this website is intended to be a simple photo gallery of amazing shots to inspire you to look at the world and think about what places you'd like to visit on your next trip or just to see the beauty of exotic foreign lands, as well as places close to home.

Created with :heart: by Petro Podrezo. Images are all property of their respective owners.

The to-do list is available publicly [on Trello](https://trello.com/b/UMuXFHMO/wonderfulworld)

## Notes For Developers
There is no backend for this site; all data is stored in static geojson files. You can see each individual location in the `db/` folder, as well as a generated file `generated/location-index.geojson` which is generated by running `npm run generate-db`; the latter contains all the former files in one location and adds some extra metadata like similar places.

## Notes For (Potential) Contributors
If you'd like to add to the list, I'd be thrilled to get new additions! Simply send me a pull request with your added .geojson files in the `db/` directory (following the existing format, and including all necessary properties) and a corresponding 700x400 pixel image (try to keep it under 400kb each) added to the `img/places/` directory.
