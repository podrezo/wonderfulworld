It was originally constructed in early 12th century as a Hindu temple for the Khmer Empire, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple at the end of the 12th century. The temple is famed for the harmony of its design and extensive decoration that is integrated with the architecture. Virtually all of its surfaces, columns, lintels and even roofs are carved to illustrate scenes from Indian literature.",

The density of its rock-hewn dwellings, churches, troglodyte villages and subterranean cities within the rock formations make it one of the world's most striking and largest cave-dwelling complexes. Though interesting from a geological and ethnological point of view, the incomparable beauty of the decor of the Christian sanctuaries makes Cappadocia one of the leading examples of the post-iconoclastic Byzantine art period, some dating back to the 4th century. Residents live in homes that are carved into the landscape. Cappadocia has a unique landscape that you will have never witnessed before in your lifetime. This makes it one of the most popular spots in the world to go up in a Hot Air Balloon.",

When the water receded, the sandy silica minerals from the seabed flowed into the rocky cracks and cavities and solidified over time into the multi-coloured gem-stone, opal. Traditionally it has been a mining town ever since the discovery of opal, but the existing cavernous mines coupled with the intense heat outside made some people take a novel approach to building - going underground.",

The park is home to hundreds of freely roaming deer. Considered in Shinto to be messengers of the gods, Nara's nearly 1200 deer have become a symbol of the city and have even been designated as a natural treasure. Nara's deer are surprisingly tame, although they can be aggressive if they think you will feed them. Deer crackers are for sale around the park, and some deer have learned to bow to visitors to ask to be fed.",

        "description": "One of the most striking of Socotra's plants is the dragon's blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari), which is a strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree. Its red sap was thought to be the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a dye, and today used as paint and varnish. Also important in ancient times were Socotra's various endemic aloes, used medicinally, and for cosmetics. Other endemic plants include the giant succulent tree Dorstenia gigas, the cucumber tree Dendrosicyos socotranus, the rare Socotran pomegranate, Aloe perryi, and Boswellia socotrana.",

It is a largely upper-class, seaside resort area, but is also a quiet seaside township in the off-peak months of the year. It was named by the Italian founders after the southern Italian town.",

        "description": "The wax palm, the Colombian national tree, is obviously the main attraction here. It is the tallest palm in the world, growing up to 60 meters, while retaining the girth of any old palm, making for a very slender giant, an immense pole topped with a little crown of palm fronds. Their wide root systems make for an odd visual: palms shooting up hundreds of feet into the sky, all widely but evenly spaced apart, as if planted purposefully.",

        "description": "The Via Appica (Appian Way) was constructed in the 4th century B.C.; it is the reason we say all roads lead to Rome. The road is remarkably well preserved, its large flat paving stones polished by millennia of use and weathering, and standing as testament to the might of Roman engineering. Today the road is flanked on both sides by verdant fields punctuated with ruins and other vestiges of Roman history, with the occasional herds of grazing sheep adding to the sense of being transported back in time. Easily accessible from Rome, this free tourist attraction literally takes a trip down Rome's memory lane.",

        "description": "The White Cliffs of Dover are cliffs that form part of the English coastline facing the Strait of Dover and France. The cliffs are part of the North Downs formation. The cliff face, which reaches up to 350 feet (110 m), owes its striking façade to its composition of chalk accentuated by streaks of black flint. The cliffs spread east and west from the town of Dover in the county of Kent, an ancient and still important English port. The cliffs have great symbolic value in Britain because they face towards Continental Europe across the narrowest part of the English Channel, where invasions have historically threatened and against which the cliffs form a symbolic guard. Because crossing at Dover was the primary route to the continent before the advent of air travel, the white line of cliffs also formed the first or last sight of England for travellers.",
